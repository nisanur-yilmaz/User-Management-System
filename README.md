The frontend of the project is built using React, HTML, CSS, and the Framer Motion library for animations.

This project uses JSON Server as a mock backend and runs only in a local environment.
Therefore, when the project is deployed on Vercel, database operations are not available.
To run the project with full functionality, it must be executed locally.
JSON Server must be started locally using the following command:
```bash
json-server --watch api/db.json --port 3004
```
